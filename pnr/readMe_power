How to run Power Calculation manually.
-------------------------------------
1. "./scripts/power.tcl" is the main tcl script called by encounter.
     1. edit the variable "toplevel" based on the design in "./scripts/pnr.tcl" 
     2. edit the encounter-database filename.
     3. point to proper activity file.

2. Run script is "./run/run_power.bash"
      Usage:
      terminal$ source run_power.bash OR
      terminal$ ./run_power.bash
      By default the log file is redirected to "../logs/power.log"

3. All reports are generated in "../reports/" directory.
      1. "./reports/${toplevel}_*power.rpt" -> includes all power calculation reports.
